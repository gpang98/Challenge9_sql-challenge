INNER JOIN salaries AS s ON s.emp_no=e.emp_no;

-- Q2. List the first name, last name, and 
--     hire date for the employees who were hired in 1986.
SELECT first_name, last_name, hire_date
FROM employees
WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM hire_date) = 1986;

-- another option

FROM employees
WHERE TO_CHAR(hire_date, 'YYYY') = '1986';


-- Q3. List the manager of each department along with their department number, 
--     department name, employee number, last name, and first name.
SELECT d.dept_no, 
  d.dept_name, 
  e.emp_no,
  e.last_name,
  e.first_name
FROM employees as e
INNER JOIN dept_manager as dm ON e.emp_no = dm.emp_no
INNER JOIN departments as d ON dm.dept_no = d.dept_no;


-- Q4. List the department number for each employee along with that 
-      employeeâ€™s employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
SELECT de.dept_no, 
  e.emp_no,
  e.last_name,
  e.first_name,
  d.dept_name
FROM employees as e
INNER JOIN dept_emp as de ON e.emp_no = de.emp_no
INNER JOIN departments as d ON de.dept_no = d.dept_no;


-- Q5. List the first name, last name, and sex of each employee whose first name 
-      is Hercules and whose last name begins with the letter B.
SELECT first_name,

WHERE first_name = 'Hercules' AND  last_name LIKE 'B%';


-- Q6. List each employee in the Sales department, including their employee number, 
-      last name, and first name.
-- Option 1: Using Sub-queries----
SELECT first_name, last_name, sex
FROM employees
WHERE emp_no IN
  (
    SELECT emp_no
    FROM dept_emp
    WHERE dept_no IN
      (
        SELECT dept_no
        FROM departments
        WHERE dept_name = 'Sales'
      )
    )
;

-- Option 2: Using INNER JOIN----
SELECT e.first_name, e.last_name, e.sex
FROM employees AS e
INNER JOIN dept_emp AS de ON e.emp_no = de.emp_no
INNER JOIN departments AS d ON de.dept_no = d.dept_no
WHERE d.dept_name = 'Sales';


-- Q7. List each employee in the Sales and Development departments, including 
-      their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

FROM employees AS e
INNER JOIN dept_emp AS de ON e.emp_no = de.emp_no
INNER JOIN departments AS d ON de.dept_no = d.dept_no
WHERE d.dept_name IN ('Sales', 'Development');


-- Q8. List the frequency counts, in descending order, of all the employee 
-      last names (that is, how many employees share each last name).
SELECT last_name, COUNT(*) as name_frequency
FROM employees
GROUP BY last_name
ORDER BY name_frequency DESC;
